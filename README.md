## About the Project
This application was developed as the final assignment for the Android Development course at HIT. Its primary goal is to demonstrate practical knowledge in Android MVVM architecture, network operations via Retrofit, local data persistence with Room, dependency injection using Dagger-Hilt, and more.

**Key Highlights**:
- Adopts MVVM to separate presentation logic from business logic.
- Fetches data from an external API using [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/).
- Caches and retrieves data offline with [Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room).
- Utilizes [Dagger-Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection.
- Employs [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) and [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) for real-time UI updates.
- Multiple fragments and a well-designed user interface, including a favorites feature.

---

## Key Features
1. **Data Retrieval** – Fetch and display live data from the external API (adaptable for any chosen API).  
2. **Offline Capability** – Stores data using Room for access when internet is unavailable.  
3. **Favorites** – Users can add, edit, and remove favorite items.  
4. **Multiple Fragments** – At least four distinct fragments, each offering unique features.  
5. **Dagger-Hilt for DI** – Organized dependency injection across modules.  
6. **MVVM** – Real-time data updates with ViewModel + LiveData in the UI layer.  
7. **Team Collaboration** – Code developed in parallel by multiple contributors, using version control (Git).  

---

## Technologies & Libraries
- **Kotlin / Java** (depending on your project choice)  
- **Retrofit** – For RESTful API interaction  
- **Room** – Local database management  
- **Dagger-Hilt** – Dependency injection  
- **Navigation Component** – In-app navigation management  
- **ViewModel + LiveData** – Core MVVM components  
- **Coroutines** (if using Kotlin) – Asynchronous operations  
- **Glide** – Image loading in RecyclerViews  
- **Android Studio** – Primary IDE  

---

## Architecture
This project follows the MVVM architecture pattern:

```
┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│    Activity   │     │    Fragment  │
└──────────────┘     └──────────────┘
        │                   │
        │ (Observes)        │
        ▼                   ▼
┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│            ViewModel            │
│  - Holds LiveData/StateFlow     │
│  - Handles UI-related logic     │
└───────────────────────────────────┘
               │
               │ (Calls)
               ▼
┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│           Repository            │
│ - Manages API calls (Retrofit)  │
│ - Manages local DB (Room)       │
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **View / UI (Activity/Fragment)**: Displays data from ViewModel and observes LiveData for changes.
- **ViewModel**: Contains the business logic and communicates with the Repository.
- **Repository**: Fetches data from both remote (Retrofit) and local storage (Room), returning it to the ViewModel.

## Installation & Setup
1. **Clone** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUserName/AndroidFinalProject.git
   ```
2. **Open** the project in **Android Studio**:
   ```bash
   File -> Open -> (Select the cloned project folder)
   ```
3. **Check** that you have the required SDK and Gradle versions listed in the `build.gradle` files.
4. **Run** the project on an **Android Emulator** (AVD) or a physical Android device.

---

## System Requirements
- **Android Studio** (up-to-date version recommended)  
- **Android SDK 21** (Lollipop) or higher (depending on your project settings)  
- **JDK 8** or higher for Kotlin/Java  
- Internet connection (for API requests)
